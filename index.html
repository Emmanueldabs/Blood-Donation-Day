           <h1>Benefits Of Blood Donations</h1>
           <h4 class="border border-danger">Donating blood is a kind act that takes little effort from the donor, but can really save lives. It is a safe way to reach out and touch someone’s life without needing to do much. The process employs the use of sterile equipment for every donor. This means that there is no risk of contracting any blood-borne infections or diseases.

            A healthy adult can easily donate up to a pint of blood with no negative side effects. And if you have a rare blood type, your blood will make an even bigger difference to whoever receives it. After donating blood, your body will naturally replace the lost fluids within 48 hours. The body replenishes the lost blood within four to eight weeks.
            
            Whenever you donate blood, you not only touch someone’s life, but also benefit from the act. Here are 5 benefits of donating blood.</h4>
            <br><br><br><br><br>
            <h4 class="border border-danger">Benefit #1: Helps Save Lives
                Everyone knows that by donating blood you save lives. But how do you save lives? Donated blood can be used in a whole range of different circumstances. Patients who were in an accident or got injured and are losing blood will need a blood transfusion to aid in their recovery. Patients undergoing surgical treatment will also need donated blood to replace blood lost during the surgery.
                
                Most donated blood will go to people who have chronic medical conditions that need blood regularly, such as cancer patients and people with blood diseases like hemophilia. These people need blood on a regular basis. It is for this reason that donating blood is such a blessing.</h4>

                <br><br><br>
                <h4 class="border border-danger">Benefit #2: Lowers Your Risk Of Getting Cancer
                    This may sound shocking to many people and they may even think it’s untrue. However, donating blood does play a great role in preventing cancer. This does not mean that a donor cannot get cancer. It just means that you can lower your chances of getting cancer by donating blood regularly.
                    
                    This is because when you donate blood, the iron stores within your body remain at a more healthy level. A lower iron store level in the body is connected to a lower cancer risk. A medical study has shown that older men were able to lower their risk for cancer by donating their blood.</h4>
                    <img src="https://www.unitypoint.org/fortdodge/filesimages/articles/you-can-prevent-7x4.jpg" alt="" class="A border border-danger rounded-pill">
                    <br><br><br>
                    <h4 class="border border-danger">Benefit #3: Reduces Iron Stores
                        Iron stimulates the body’s cells to release free radicals. These are unstable molecules that can lead to cancer and other diseases related to ageing such as diabetes. Too much iron is also linked to metabolic syndrome that is characterized by hypertension, obesity, insulin resistance, and glucose intolerance. Studies show that many people take in more iron than their bodies actually need to maintain good health.
                        
                        By donating blood, you reduce iron stores in your body and, therefore, lower your risk of developing a number of diseases as well as keeping your heart healthy. With every blood donation, you lower the iron levels in your body and thus reduce your risk of getting many diseases.</h4>

                        <br><br><br>
                        <h4 class="border border-danger">Benefit #4: Burns Calories
                            This will probably surprise you, but donating blood often helps you to burn some calories. In fact, your body can burn up to 650 calories every time you donate one pint of blood. This happens due to the process your body goes through to replace the blood plasma that is lost during the donation.
                            
                            This means that a person who donates blood regularly loses weight as a result. However, blood donation should not be seen as a quick way to lose weight. After all, you need to wait for at least 56 days before donating another pint of blood. If you are looking to lose weight, follow a healthy diet and proper exercise.</h4>

                            <br><br><br>
                            <h4 class="border border-danger">Benefit #5: Improves Heart Health
                                Another surprising health benefit of donating blood regularly is the fact that it helps improve the health of your heart. Once again, high body iron stores come into play in the health of your body. High iron stores increase your risk factor for acute myocardial infarction, which is the other name for a heart attack. Therefore, by donating blood, you can reduce your risk by effectively decreasing your iron levels.
                                
                                According to a study, the risk of a heart attack was lower in people who regularly donated blood when compared to their counterparts who did not donate blood at all.</h4>
